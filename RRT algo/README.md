# RRT

The code implements RRT (Rapidly exploring Random Trees) path planning algorithm in Python.

The Start, Goal and Obstacle co-ordinates can be changed from within the code itself.
The format for Start and Goal coordinate is: (x,y), and the range for coordinates can be -2 <= x,y <= 15.
The format for Obstacle coordinates is: (x,y,r) where r is the radius of the obstacle.
